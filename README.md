# GoBoids

Boids Implemented in Golang

Based on [Conrad Parker's Boids Pseudo-code](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html) 

## Getting Started

This was written using JetBrains GoLand, and SDL2

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install SDL2, on macOS use Brew.

```
brew install sdl2
```

Running the app will open a window and display a number of dots that fly around
like a flock a birds.
